# Bitcoin Optech's Compatibility Website

The Bitcoin Optech Group is bringing together a set of compatibility analyses of Bitcoin ecosystem services into a single website. The website can:

- Serve as a reference point for Bitcoin end users evaluating Bitcoin services (wallet, exchange, block explorers, etc) based on their support of Bitcoin features and best practices
- Serve as a reference point for Bitcoin developers and designers exploring how the ecosystem implements certain Bitcoin features from a usability perspective
- Serve as a gauge for the Bitcoin ecosystem as to how much adoption various Bitcoin features have achieved over time
- Serve as a social motivating factor for Bitcoin services to adopt Bitcoin features and best practices

Analyses may include support and usability regarding:

- RBF 
- Bech32
- CPFP
